<p>Several improvements and features were made/added:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1. Slightly better handling: The 'add' command now has additional handling for when the file data is empty (not asking what index the byte should be in, since that is redundant).</li>
  <li>2. Direct page: Users can now directly jump to a specific page, rather than switching to the previous and the next pages.</li>
  <li>3. File Not Found: When there is no file found on the filepath, instead of exiting immediately, the application now asks if the user would like to create a new file from scratch.</li>
  <li>4. Corruption: A scary bug where saving certain files makes them corrupted has been fixed.</li>
  <li>5. File Length: When creating a new file, users can specify how long the file is (in bytes).</li>
  <li>6. Embedding Text: Users can also now embed text inside the file data instead of editing each byte manually. This is useful for adding in secret messages, or setting configurations for the file.</li>
</ul>
