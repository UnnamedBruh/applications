<p style="color: green">This page may update overtime as more applications are being created, and mistakes in this page are found (which are going to be fixed). For an example, people do not have to download a range of versions - we apologize for the inconvenience if our users feel choiceless. <i>At least we got that out of our way before we run into more issues.</i></p>

<p style="color: red">I won't be releasing version 0.0.0.6 due to changes in my interest.</p>

<p>If you are wondering if my account is no longer active, this is because I have decided to not update my application anymore, and giving up my award of having the most frequent application updates ever (if I even won an award)! This is because I thought our users didn't want to just edit raw file data, but users might have wanted to also edit images and do other crazy things. My latest project is at <a href="https://unnamedbruh.github.io/newer-image-editor/imageEditor.html">this link</a>.</p>

<h1>What exactly Is Marniline?</h1>
<p>Marniline is a console-based application that may use the Command Prompt's console, which is the program's UI interface. The application is designed to access your disk, and others may not be implemented. <b>You should use this application at your own risk, since this application may have bugs that need to be addressed.</b> By downloading the application, you agree to make sure not to open any internal files created automatically on your disk drive in your computer, and do so only to and if a copy of an internal file has been created only by you or someone else (and not the internals itself) or the internal files are opened from an emulated environment. This application is distributed under the MIT License.</p>
<h1>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h1>
<p>Q: Is the program secure to download?</p>
<p>Short A: Yes.</p>
<p>Long A: Yes, the program may access your disk, and only the file you had loaded. However, it is recommended you make copies of the files you want to load into the program before changing the files; the program may completely overwrite the file you loaded. There is no redo and undo feature.</p>
<p>Q: Are we (the users who created the application, published the application and made updates to the application) responsible for the damages from the application?</p>
<p>A: No; you (the user/person downloading the application) are legally held responsible for the damages you cause on your own computer from using the application. The application is only functional if you interact with it. We will also highly recommend you to <b>never</b> edit the original internal files of your computer, as doing so will cause your computer irrepairable damage, or cause minor or major issues with your computer. However if you know the risks of this application, then you may experiment with the internal files - but make a copy of them ONTO ANOTHER FOLDER, not the internal files folder themselves!</a></p>
<p>Q: Are there going to be updates for this application?</p>
<p>A: There were going to be updates, but due to changes in my interest focus, there will not be any more updates to this application.</p>
<p>Q: Is this application free to download?</p>
<p>A: Yes, it is completely free to download. You will not be charged with any fees while using this application.</p>
<p>Q: Why did you come up with this program? There are already a lot of hex editors!</p>
<p>A: It was because - some hex editors were not exactly easy to use, or didn't have the advanced tools I previously wanted to implement in the future. A lot of hex editors were also not text-based either. So that is why I came up with the Marniline application.</p>
<p>Q: Are you inactive?</p>
<p>A: I can sometimes be active, but I am most of the time inactive, due to working on the applications frequently.</p>
