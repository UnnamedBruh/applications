<h1>What exactly Is Marniline?</h1>
<p>Marniline is a console-based application that may use the Command Prompt's console to display information and help the user interact with the application. The application is designed to access your disk, but <u>this is not guaranteed</u>, as other components may need to be accessed for future versions. <b>You should use this application at your own risk, since this application may have bugs that need to be addressed, and improvements that will be made in the future.</b></p>
<p>(This application is distributed under the MIT License. A segment of the application description has been adjusted to avoid potential legal ambiguities. The license text itself, has not been modified in any way, shape, or form.)</p>
<h1>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h1>
<p>Q: Is the program secure to download?</p>
<p>Short A: Yes.</p>
<p>Long A: Yes, the program has been limited to only access to the user's disk, and only the file you had loaded. However, it is recommended you make copies of the files you want to load into the program before changing the files; the program may completely overwrite the file you loaded!</p>
<p>Q: Are you responsible for the damages from the application?</p>
<p>A: No; you are legally help responsible for the damages you cause on your own computer from using the application! The application is only functional if you interact with it! I will also highly recommend you to <b>never, ever</b> edit the internal files of your computer, as doing so will cause your computer irrepairable damage, or cause minor or major issues with your computer! But if you know the risks that were stated, then you may experiment with the internal files - but make a copy of them ONTO ANOTHER FOLDER, not the internal files folder themselves!</a></p>
<p>Q: Are there going to be updates for this program?</p>
<p>A: Yes, I will continue improving and updating the program, and trying to fix the bugs I can. Helping me - either by commenting how the software might enocunter certain problems (if you can accurately guess the issue) or telling me solutions to certain problems - can help me make this application very diverse, and more friendly to anyone who might not have the knowledge of what certain terms may mean (e.g. file path).</p>
<p>Q: Why did you censor your own username in the introduction video you posted on your YouTube account?</p>
<p>A: I did it for privacy reasons, so censoring that name will help prevent leaks of some of my information.</p>
<p>Q: Is this program free to download?</p>
<p>A: I just mentioned in the YouTube video: Yes, it is free to download!</p>
<p>Q: Why did you come up with this program? There are already a lot of hex editors!</p>
<p>A: It was because - some hex editors were not exactly easy to use, or didn't have the advanced tools I want to implement in the future. A lot of hex editors were also not text-based either. So that is why I came up with Marniline.</p>
