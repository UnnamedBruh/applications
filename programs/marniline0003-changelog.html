<p>Some improvements and features were made/added:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1. Author and Legal Trademark: Both two properties have been added to the third version of the program, so people on Windows computers won't experience screens of the file being suspicious/malicious (the application was not designed to harm your computer), or people can verify the program's legitimacy.</li>
  <li>2. New Files: Users can now create their own new files from scratch, which was not requested, but is a very useful feature.</li>
  <li>3. Adding Bytes: The 'add' command has been added, letting users add bytes to the data other than removing them only.</li>
  <li>4. Viewing in Hexadecimal or Integer Format (almost forgot to add to this changelog): Users can now view the file data in the hexadecimal, or integer format.</li>
</ul>
