<p>Several improvements were made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1. Licensing Adjusts: The license now automatically adjusts it's year when a Happy New Year happens, which helps UnnamedBruh reduce the amount of times the program needs to be manually updated.</li>
  <li>2. Several Commands: Several new commands were added, such as 'load', 'reload', 'next', 'prev', 'first', and 'last'. Also, 'exit' was a command that wasn't shown before, but now shows in this update.</li>
  <li>3. Hexadecimal Format: This bug was addressed when the program didn't readjust it's own format when the console screen refreshed.</li>
  <li>4. Paging: A paging system was added, so users can modify the program's data without getting very overwhelmed by the data.</li>
  <li>5. Copyright: The copyright property was added to the program as well as the first version of the program, so the copyright is not only in the program's license, but also when users inspect the properties of the program.</li>
  <li>6. Clarifications: The commands have been clarified for easier editing and understanding, so users can edit files easier without having to perform the full command to learn it.</li>
  <li>7. License Ending Clarification: The "END OF MIT LICENSE" section has been changed to "END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS" for a more professional feel, and to help clarify the license.</li>
  <li>8. Visibility: The visibility of the results have been improved and added (some commands not showing the users the final status, others showing the status for only a brief second), so users can solve certain issues without having to figure it out themselves.</li>
</ul>
