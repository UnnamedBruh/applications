<p>Several improvements and features were made/added:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1. New commands: Two new commands were added: 'invert', and 'resize'. 'invert' inverts the file data inside a range, while 'resize' would set the buffer's size (and optionally let the user specifiy the padding, if the user wants the size to grow).</li>
  <li>2. Optimized: The application has been optimized for computers with very restricted disk storage, and memory. Now certain loops are unrolled, and functions are inlined.</li>
  <li>3. The lie: A very big apology for the 'load' command - it didn't exist!! I was so busy implementing other features, that I even forgot to add one! JUST ONE! But now, I finally did it...</li>
  <li>4. Bounding: The batchremove command has been improved to better handle removing the bytes - specifically, the range.</li>
  <li>5. Embedtext: The embedtext command has been fixed to address the memory corruption issue! It is not the memory corruption - it was instead a memory <b>overflow</b>!</li>
  <li>6. Filepath: Users can now see the current filepath for the file, and set the filepath to a different one whenever they want.</li>
</ul>
